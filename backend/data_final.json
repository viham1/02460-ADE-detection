      "abstract": "Introduction: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a malignant haemopathy that falls within the scope of chronic myeloproliferative syndromes, predominant on the granular line. Its drug treatment is based on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ITKs) that inhibit the abnormal BCR-ABL protein kinase causing CML and thus block the signals that cause cancer cells to multiply abnormally. However, other proteins are also inhibited, so they can cause a wide range of adverse reactions (ADRs). The objective of this study was to study the prevalence of ITK AEs used in the therapeutic management of CML by the HEC hematology department of Sidi Bel-Abbès in Algeria and that of stopping an ITK after an IE. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective descriptive study carried out over a period of four months, from 01 April 2021 to 31 July 2021, covering patients with CML and treated with KTIs in the hematology department of the CHU of Sidi Bel-Abbès in Algeria. The primary endpoint was the prevalence of ARs related to the use of normal doses or overdose of the following KTIs: Imatinib, Dasatinib and Nilotinib. The data were collected from patient records, completed by the doctors of the hematology department, using a questionnaire, and analysed by the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software, version 20. Results: A total of 40 patients were included, including 22 women, aged 51.55 ± 11.66 years (23–78). Twenty-six patients reported at least one AR. Of the 106 ARs reported, 69 ARs (65.09%) reported with Imatinib, 26 ARs (24.53%) with Dasatinib and 11 ARs (10.38%) with Nilotinib. Predominance of musculoskeletal effects 43 (40.56 per cent), followed by general disorders 18 (17 per cent), myelosuppression 14 (13.20 per cent) and digestive system 12 (11.32%). ARs were responsible for a definitive stoppage of KTI in three cases (11.54%), two of which (7.70%) were due to Imatinib due to neutropenia and one case (03.84%) due to dasatinib with pleural effusion. ARs were controlled in 13 (50%) of the cases, of which 9 (34.62%) were temporarily discontinued and 4 (15.38%) were dose reductions, resulting in improved symptoms and continued or reintroduced treatment. Conclusion: The prevalence of ARs was high in the study population, their occurrence was inevitable, good management of ARs at the time of initiation of treatment is necessary to avoid change to another ITK especially in the correct responders. It is recommended to introduce a hyposodium diet for all KTIs and a low-glucose diet especially for Nilotinib and not to rush to stop KTI because, most often, ARs regress over time to allow for good therapeutic adhesion and to achieve better results.",
      "original_abstract": "Introduction : La leucémie myéloïde chronique (LMC), est une hémopathie maligne entrant dans le cadre des syndromes myéloprolifératifs chroniques, prédominant sur la lignée granuleuse. Son traitement médicamenteux est basé sur les inhibiteurs de tyrosine kinase (ITK) qui inhibent la protéine kinase anormale BCR-ABL à l’origine de la LMC et bloquent ainsi les signaux qui poussent les cellules cancéreuses à se multiplier anormalement. Cependant d’autres protéines sont également inhibées, par conséquent, ils peuvent être à l’origine d’une large gamme d’effets indésirables (EI). L’objectif de cette étude était d’étudier la prévalence des EI des ITK utilisés dans la prise en charge thérapeutique de la LMC par le service d’hématologie du CHU de Sidi Bel-Abbès en Algérie et celle de l’arrêt d’un ITK suite à un EI. Matériels et Méthodes: Il s’agissait d’une étude descriptive rétrospective réalisée sur une période de quatre mois, allant du 01 avril 2021 au 31 juillet 2021 portant sur les patients présentant une LMC et traités par les ITK dans le service d’hématologie du CHU de Sidi Bel-Abbès en Algérie. Le critère de jugement principal était la prévalence des EI liés à l’utilisation des posologies normales ou d’un surdosage des ITK suivants : Imatinib,Dasatinib et Nilotinib. Les données ont été collectées à partir des dossiers de patients, remplies par les médecins du service d’hématologie, à l’aide d’un questionnaire, et analysées par le logiciel Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 20. Résultats : Au total, 40 patients ont été inclus dont 22 femmes, d’âge moyen 51,55 ± 11,66 ans (23–78). Vingt-six patients ont déclaré au moins un EI. Parmi les 106 EI déclarés, 69 EI (65,09 %) déclarés sous Imatinib, 26 EI (24,53 %) sous Dasatinib et 11 EI (10,38 %) sous Nilotinib. Une prédominance des effets musculo-squelettiques 43 (40,56 %), suivis des troubles généraux 18 (17 %), de myélosuppression 14 (13,20 %) et du système digestif 12 (11,32 %). Les EI étaient responsables d’un arrêt définitif de l’ITK dans trois cas (11,54 %), dont deux cas (7,70 %) sous Imatinibà cause d’une neutropénie et un cas (03,84 %) sous Dasatinib soufrant d’un épanchement pleural. Les EI ont pu être contrôlés dans 13 (50 %) des cas, dont 9 (34,62 %) par un arrêt provisoire et 4 (15,38 %) par une baisse de posologie, permettant une amélioration des symptômes et la poursuite ou la réintroduction du traitement. Conclusion : La prévalence des EI était élevée dans la population étudiée, leur survenue était inéluctable, une bonne gestion des EI dès l’instauration du traitement est nécessaire pour éviter le changement vers un autre ITK surtout chez les bons répondeurs. Il est recommandé d’instaurer au préalable un régime hyposodé pour tous les ITK et un régime pauvre en glucide surtout pour le Nilotinib et de ne pas se précipiter à arrêter l’ITK car le plus souvent, les EI régressent au fil du temps afin de permettre une bonne adhérence thérapeutique et d’obtenir de meilleurs résultats.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Side effects of hydroxychloroquine(HC) are dominated by eye and skin damage. The purpose of our work was to study the clinical and evolutionary characteristics of the skin side effects (EICs) of this molecule. Patients and Methods: A retrospective study conducted between January 2013 and May 2018. We collected all cases of CIS attributed to the use of HC. Results: Twenty-two patients, including 21 women, presented an EIC. The HLC was prescribed for systemic lupus erythematosus (16 cases), plan lichen (1 case), Gougerot-Sjögren syndrome (1 case), systemic scleroderma (2 cases), facial erythema (1 case) and oral aphtosis (1 case). Hyperpigmentations were most common (13 cases, 59%) followed by generalised acute exanthematic pustulosis (GEP) (5 cases, 22.7%), maculopapular exanthema (MPE) (3 cases, 13.7%) and DRESS. The hyperpigmentation was noted only in lupic patients and was the type of brown to black macules most frequently located in the legs (8 cases). The lesions appeared after an average of 34 months (6–108). HC treatment was continued in these lupic patients. The GAP had appeared after an average of 44 days (d) (15–120 days). The rash was characteristic of an oedematic erythema sprinkled with descending pustules of evolution. The shutdown of the HC allowed the complete regression of the eruption within an average time of 26 days. The average time of the HC was after 33 days of taking the HC. The regression of the eruption was obtained on average 7 days after the shutdown of the HC. A DRESS occurred in a 64-year-old woman 30 days after taking HC. It had fever associated with EMP, facial oedema and cheilitis. Biology showed hyperleucocytosis at NNP and hypereosinophilia. The diagnosis of DRESS was probable (RegisCAR at 4). The shutdown of the HC allowed for the regression of the eruption after one month. Discussion: There are many HC EICs. Skin hyperpigmentation was the most found effect in our series. This finding is consistent with the literature. Serious toxidermias to the HC have been reported, the most common of which is the PEAP, which is characterized by prolonged delays of appearance and healing as was the case with our patients. The HC DRESS seen in one of our patients is rarely described. Other ICEs are described such as alopecia, pruritus and skin xerosis. No case of these EICs was noted in our series. Conclusion: Through this series, we emphasize the interest of health care professionals in informing them of the need to comply with the indications of HC in order to avoid potentially serious ICEs",
      "original_abstract": "Introduction : Les effets secondaires de l’hydroxychloroquine(HC) sont dominés par l’atteinte oculaire et cutanée. Le but de notre travail était d’étudier les caractéristiques cliniques et évolutives des effets indésirables cutanés (EIC) de cette molécule. Patients et méthodes : Étude rétrospective menée entre janvier 2013 et mai 2018. Nous avons recueilli tous les cas d’EIC imputés à la prise d’HC. Résultats : vingt-deux patients, dont 21 femmes, ont présenté un EIC. L’HC était prescrite dans le cadre d’un lupus érythémateux systémique (16 cas), un lichen plan (1 cas), un syndrome de Gougerot-Sjögren (1 cas), une sclérodermie systémique (2 cas), un érythème du visage (1 cas) et une aphtose buccale (1 cas). Les hyperpigmentations étaient l’EIC le plus fréquent (13 cas, 59 %) suivies de la pustulose exanthématique aigue généralisée (PEAG) (5 cas, 22,7 %), exanthème maculopapuleux (EMP) (3 cas, 13,7 %) et un DRESS. L’hyperpigmentation était notée uniquement chez des patients lupiques et était à type de macules brunes à noires localisées le plus fréquemment au niveau des jambes (8 cas). Les lésions étaient apparues après une durée moyenne de 34 mois (6–108). Le traitement par HC était poursuivi chez ces patients lupiques. La PEAG était apparue après un délai moyen de 44 jours (j) (15–120 j). L’éruption était caractéristique faite par un érythème œdémateux parsemé de pustules d’évolution descendante. L’arrêt de l’HC a permis la régression complète de l’éruption dans un délai moyen de 26 j. L’EMP survenait en moyenne après 33 j de prise d’HC. La régression de l’éruption était obtenue en moyenne 7 j après l’arrêt de l’HC. Un DRESS était survenu chez une femme de 64 ans, 30 j après la prise d’HC. Elle présentait une fièvre associée à un EMP, un œdème du visage et une chéilite. La biologie a montré une hyperleucocytose à PNN et une hyperéosinophilie. Le diagnostic de DRESS était probable (RegiSCAR à 4). L’arrêt de l’HC a permis la régression de l’éruption au bout d’un mois. Discussion : Les EIC de l’HC sont nombreux. L’hyperpigmentation cutanée était l’effet le plus retrouvé dans notre série. Cette constatation est conforme aux données de la littérature. Des toxidermies graves à l’HC ont été rapportées, dont la plus fréquente est la PEAG qui se caractérise par des délais prolongés d’apparition et de guérison comme était le cas de nos malades. Le DRESS à l’HC constaté chez l’une de nos patients est rarement décrit. D’autres EIC sont décrits tels que l’alopécie, le prurit et la xérose cutanée. Aucun cas de ces EIC n’était noté dans notre série. Conclusion : À travers cette série, nous soulignons l’intérêt de l’information des professionnels de la santé sur la nécessité de respecter les indications de l’HC afin d’éviter les EIC potentiellement graves.",

      "abstract": "A 71-year-old woman with bradycardia, but otherwise healthy, was hospitalized for the installation of a pacemaker. She received a dose of cefazoline during the procedure. The next day, it had a pruriginous morbilliform rash at the lower extremities. Two days later, rash was generalized and accompanied by confluent erythematous plates covered with nonfollicular pustules (Figure 1). The mucous membranes were intact. The patient was febrile and had leucocytosis (34 × 109/L [normal range 4.5–11 × 109/L]). A diagnosis of generalised acute exanthemotic pustulosis due to cefazoline was made, supported by a histological examination, which showed the presence of corneal pustules, spongiosis, perivascular neutrophils and exocytosis of eosinophiles. The patient received no other dose of cefazoline and was given a betamethasone-based cream (0.1%), to be applied to the affected skin twice daily for 2 weeks. No systemic steroids were administered. The eruption has been completely resorbed.",
      "original_abstract": "Une femme de 71 ans présentant de la bradycardie, mais autrement en santé, a été hospitalisée pour l’installation d’un stimulateur cardiaque. Elle a reçu une dose de céfazoline durant l’intervention. Le lendemain, elle présentait une éruption morbilliforme prurigineuse aux extrémités inférieures. Deux jours plus tard, l’éruption était généralisée et accompagnée de plaques érythémateuses confluentes recouvertes de pustules non folliculaires (figure 1). Les muqueuses étaient intactes. La patiente était fébrile et présentait une leucocytose (34 × 109/L [plage normale 4,5–11 × 109/L]). Un diagnostic de pustulose exanthématique aiguë généralisée attribuable à la céfazoline a été posé, appuyé par un examen histologique, qui a montré la présence de pustules sous cornées, d’une spongiose, de neutrophiles périvasculaires et d’une exocytose d’éosinophiles. La patiente n’a reçu aucune autre dose de céfazoline et s’est vu prescrire une crème à base de bétaméthasone (0,1 %), à appliquer sur la peau affectée 2 fois par jour pendant 2 semaines. Aucun stéroïde systémique n’a été administré. L’éruption s’est complètement résorbée.",

      "abstract": "Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (Relvar(®)) is a once-daily, fixed combination of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and a long-acting β2-adrenoreceptor agonist (LABA), delivered via a dry powder inhaler (Ellipta(®)). It is approved for the treatment of asthma in the EU and Japan, and is the first once-daily ICS/LABA to be available for this indication. Fluticasone furoate is an enhanced-affinity glucocorticoid receptor agonist, with potent anti-inflammatory activity. Vilanterol produces rapid and prolonged bronchodilation. In phase III trials in adolescents and adults with various levels of asthma uncontrolled on ICS and/or ICS/LABA, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100/25 or 200/25 µg once daily (approved dosages in the EU) significantly improved pulmonary function compared with placebo or equivalent dosages of fluticasone furoate alone (in some trials) or fluticasone propionate. In similar trials, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100/25 µg once daily was as effective as fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250/50 µg twice daily in improving pulmonary function and significantly reduced the risk of severe asthma exacerbation relative to fluticasone furoate alone. In clinical trials, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol was generally well tolerated with fewer than 15 % of patients experiencing treatment-related adverse events, the most common of which were oral/oropharyngeal candidiasis, dysphonia, extrasystoles and cough. The tolerability profile of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol was generally similar to that of fluticasone propionate/salmeterol. Thus, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol is an effective and generally well tolerated ICS/LABA option for the treatment of uncontrolled asthma.",

Recurrence of fever was noted in three patients after five to seven days of cefuroxime sodium therapy for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. No source of infection was found and the fevers resolved within 30 hours of drug discontinuation. One patient was rechallenged; the same pattern of fever resulted. Fever secondary to cephalosporin administration is reviewed and the place of cephalosporins in the differential diagnosis of fever is postulated. Cefuroxime should be added to the list of cephalosporins that induce fever.",

      "abstract": "Carvedilol has been identified as a promising agent for the treatment of liver fibrosis. Meanwhile, autophagy and apoptosis have been reported to play key roles in the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which can contribute to the progression of liver fibrosis. However, the effects of carvedilol on autophagy and apoptosis in HSCs remain unclear. Our study aimed to detect these effects and identify the underlying mechanisms by which carvedilol mediates HSC autophagy and apoptosis. For this purpose, the LX-2 cell line was used in this study, and the cells were exposed to various concentrations of carvedilol for specific times. First, we found that carvedilol increased autophagic marker levels, the number of GFP-LC3-containing puncta and LC3B-II levels in LX-2 cells. Interestingly, the addition of chloroquine (CQ) failed to enhance the effects on GFP-LC3 puncta and LC3B-II levels, and carvedilol treatment resulted in a significant increase in p62 protein levels. Moreover, carvedilol treatment led to the accumulation of yellow dots only in GFP-RFP-LC3-LX-2 cells, similar to the results following CQ treatment, indicating that carvedilol inhibited autophagic flux. Next, we found evidence that carvedilol inhibited autophagic flux by increasing lysosomal pH and not by impairing the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. Moreover, carvedilol substantially reduced the viability of LX-2 cells and noticeably induced cell apoptosis, as observed by flow cytometry. In addition, increased levels of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-8 and cleaved PARP, increased Bax activity and decreased Bcl-2 expression were detected in LX-2 cells. Finally, the carvedilol treatment inhibited autophagy and subsequently induced apoptosis in vitro. In conclusion, carvedilol suppresses autophagy and promotes apoptosis in HSCs and the late-stage inhibition of autophagy preceded the induction of apoptosis.",

A 31-year-old woman was diagnosed as having seasonal influenza and treated with Relenza. However, an allergic reaction and blurred vision caused by a transient myopic change were noted after she received Relenza treatment. Relenza-induced acute transient myopia had never been reported. The possible mechanisms include (1) ciliary spasm, (2) lens edema, (3) ciliary body and/or choroidal effusion. Fortunately, the drug-induced myopic change mostly resolved spontaneously after discontinuation of the drug and had a benign course. Patients suspected of having drug-induced myopia should be examined by an internist for a systemic allergic reaction and referred to an optometrist or an ophthalmologist for further special examinations such as A-scan, B-scan, and ultrasound biomicroscopy. Optometrists and ophthalmologists should keep in mind and be aware of the possible ocular side effect (myopic change) of Relenza and warn patients of this potential condition.",

      "abstract": "Belantamab mafodotin (GSK2857916), an immunoconjugate targeting B-cell maturation antigen, showed single-agent activity in the phase 1 DREAMM-1 study in heavily pre-treated patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. We further investigated the safety and activity of belantamab mafodotin in the DREAMM-2 study. DREAMM-2 is an open-label, two-arm, phase 2 study done at 58 multiple myeloma specialty centres in eight countries. Patients (aged ≥18 years) with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma with disease progression after three or more lines of therapy and who were refractory to immunomodulatory drugs and proteasome inhibitors, and refractory or intolerant (or both) to an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 were recruited, centrally randomly assigned (1:1) with permuted blocks (block size 4), and stratified by previous lines of therapy (≤4 vs >4) and cytogenetic features to receive 2·5 mg/kg or 3·4 mg/kg belantamab mafodotin via intravenous infusion every 3 weeks on day 1 of each cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The intention-to-treat population comprised all randomised patients, regardless of treatment administration. The safety population comprised all patients who received at least one dose of belantamab mafodotin. The primary outcome was the proportion of randomly assigned patients in the intention-to-treat population who achieved an overall response, as assessed by an independent review committee. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03525678, and is ongoing. Between June 18, 2018, and Jan 2, 2019, 293 patients were screened and 196 were included in the intention-to-treat population (97 in the 2·5 mg/kg cohort and 99 in the 3·4 mg/kg cohort). As of June 21, 2019 (the primary analysis data cutoff date), 30 (31%; 97·5% CI 20·8-42·6) of 97 patients in the 2·5 mg/kg cohort and 34 (34%; 23·9-46·0) of 99 patients in the 3·4 mg/kg cohort achieved an overall response. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events in the safety population were keratopathy (in 26 [27%] of 95 patients in the 2·5 mg/kg cohort and 21 [21%] of 99 patients in the 3·4 mg/kg cohort), thrombocytopenia (19 [20%] and 33 [33%]), and anaemia (19 [20%] and 25 [25%]); 38 (40%) of 95 patients in the 2·5 mg/kg cohort and 47 (47%) of 99 in the 3·4 mg/kg cohort reported serious adverse events. Two deaths were potentially treatment related (one case of sepsis in the 2·5 mg/kg cohort and one case of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in the 3·4 mg/kg cohort). Single-agent belantamab mafodotin shows anti-myeloma activity with a manageable safety profile in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. GlaxoSmithKline.",

Four hundred and eight patients (treatment-naïve or after a 4-week wash-out period) were randomized to receive empagliflozin 5, 10 or 25 mg once daily, placebo or open-label metformin for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) after 12 weeks. After 12 weeks' treatment, empagliflozin showed dose-dependent reductions in HbA1c from baseline [5 mg: -0.4%, 10 mg: -0.5%, 25 mg: -0.6%; all doses p < 0.0001 vs. placebo (+0.09%)]. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) decreased with empagliflozin [5 mg: -1.29 mmol/l, 10 mg: -1.61 mmol/l, 25 mg: -1.72 mmol/l; all doses p < 0.0001 vs. placebo (+0.04 mmol/l)]. Body weight decreased in all empagliflozin groups (all doses p < 0.001 vs. placebo). The incidence of adverse events (AEs) was similar in the placebo (32.9%) and empagliflozin (29.1%) groups. The most frequently reported AEs on empagliflozin were pollakiuria (3.3% vs. 0% for placebo), thirst (3.3% vs. 0% for placebo) and nasopharyngitis (2.0% vs. 1.2% for placebo). AEs consistent with urinary tract infections (UTIs) were reported in four (1.6%) patients on empagliflozin vs. one (1.2%) on placebo. Genital infections were reported in five (2%) patients on empagliflozin vs. 0% on placebo. No UTIs or genital infections led to premature discontinuation. In patients with type 2 diabetes, empagliflozin resulted in dose-dependent, clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c and FPG, and reductions in body weight compared with placebo. Empagliflozin was well-tolerated with a favourable safety profile.",

The goal of this study was to determine if the addition of once-daily ropinirole 24-hour prolonged-release (n = 104) in PD patients not optimally controlled with levodopa after up to 3 years of therapy with less than 600 mg/d delays the onset of dyskinesia compared with increasing doses of levodopa (n = 104). During the study, 3% of the ropinirole prolonged-release group (mean dose 10 mg/d) and 17% of the levodopa group (mean additional dose 284 mg/d) developed dyskinesia (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in change in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale activities of daily living or motor scores, suggesting comparable efficacy between the two treatments. Adverse events were comparable in the two groups with nausea, dizziness, insomnia, back pain, arthralgia, somnolence, fatigue, and pain most commonly reported. Ropinirole prolonged-release delayed the onset of dyskinesia with comparable efficacy to increased doses of levodopa in early PD patients not optimally controlled with levodopa.",

      "abstract": "Babesiosis is a tick-borne, malaria-like illness known to be enzootic in southern New England. A course of clindamycin and quinine is the standard treatment, but this regimen frequently causes adverse reactions and occasionally fails. A promising alternative treatment is atovaquone plus azithromycin. We conducted a prospective, nonblinded, randomized trial of the two regimens in 58 subjects with non-life-threatening babesiosis on Nantucket, on Block Island, and in southern Connecticut. The subjects were assigned to receive either atovaquone (750 mg every 12 hours) and azithromycin (500 mg on day 1 and 250 mg per day thereafter) for seven days (40 subjects) or clindamycin (600 mg every 8 hours) and quinine (650 mg every 8 hours) for seven days (18 subjects). Adverse effects were reported by 15 percent of the subjects who received atovaquone and azithromycin, as compared with 72 percent of those who received clindamycin and quinine (P<0.001). The most common adverse effects with atovaquone and azithromycin were diarrhea and rash (each in 8 percent of the subjects); with clindamycin and quinine the most common adverse effects were tinnitus (39 percent), diarrhea (33 percent), and decreased hearing (28 percent). Symptoms had resolved three months after the start of therapy in 65 percent of those who received atovaquone and azithromycin and 73 percent of those who received clindamycin and quinine (P=0.66), and after six months no patient in either group had symptoms. Three months after the completion of the assigned regimen, no parasites could be seen on microscopy, and no Babesia microti DNA was detected in the blood of any subject. For the treatment of babesiosis, a regimen of atovaquone and azithromycin is as effective as a regimen of clindamycin and quinine and is associated with fewer adverse reactions.",

Twenty-one (75%) of 28 patients receiving pyrimethamine (95% lower confidence interval [CI], 58%) and 9 (82%) of 11 patients receiving sulfadiazine (95% lower CI, 53%) responded to treatment for acute disease. Of 20 patients in the maintenance phase, only 1 experienced relapse. Eleven (28%) of 40 eligible patients discontinued treatment as a result of adverse events, 9 because of nausea and vomiting or intolerance of the taste of the atovaquone suspension. Although gastrointestinal side effects were frequent, atovaquone-containing regimens are otherwise well tolerated and safe and may be useful for patients intolerant of standard regimens for toxoplasmic encephalitis.",
