      "abstract": "Antidepressants are associated with traumatic injury and are widely used with other medications. It remains unknown how drug-drug-drug interactions (3DIs) between antidepressants and two other drugs may impact potential injury risks associated with antidepressants. We aimed to generate hypotheses regarding antidepressant 3DI signals associated with elevated injury rates. Using 2000-2020 Optum's de-identified Clinformatics Data Mart, we performed a self-controlled case series study for each drug triad consisting of an antidepressant + codispensed drug (base-pair) with a candidate interacting medication (precipitant). We included persons aged greater than or equal to 16 years who (1) experienced an injury and (2) used a candidate precipitant, during base-pair therapy. We compared injury rates during observation time exposed to the drug triad versus the base-pair only, adjusting for time-varying covariates. We calculated adjusted rate ratios (RRs) using conditional Poisson regression and accounted for multiple comparisons via semi-Bayes shrinkage. Among 147,747 eligible antidepressant users with an injury, we studied 120,714 antidepressant triads, of which 334 (0.3%) were positively associated with elevated injury rates and thus considered potential 3DI signals. Adjusted RRs for signals ranged from 1.31 (1.04-1.65) for sertraline + levothyroxine with tramadol (vs. without tramadol) to 6.60 (3.23-13.46) for escitalopram + simvastatin with aripiprazole (vs. without aripiprazole). Nearly half of the signals (137, 41.0%) had adjusted RRs greater than or equal to 2, suggesting strong associations with injury. The identified signals may represent antidepressant 3DIs of potential clinical concern and warrant future etiologic studies to test these hypotheses.",

      "abstract": "Interscalene block, the gold standard for shoulder surgeries is inevitably associated with phrenic nerve palsy, even at low volumes. The major innervation of the shoulder joint is by suprascapular nerve and axillary nerve. Suprascapular nerve block has been used commonly for postoperative analgesia in shoulder surgeries done under GA. Combining axillary block with suprascapular nerve block was found to provide superior analgesia when compared to suprascapular block alone. Selective Suprascapular and Axillary nerve (SSAX) block provides effective analgesia in shoulder surgeries without causing diaphragm palsy, but has limited published literature. We performed ultrasound guided suprascapular block in the supraspinous fossa (posterior approach) using 10 ml of 0.25% Ropivacaine and axillary block in the quadrangular space using 6ml of 0.25% Ropivacaine before administration of general anaesthesia (GA) in 4 cases. Among four cases, 2 were closed shoulder manipulation with intra-articular steroid injection for periarthritis, 1 was closed reduction and K-wire fixation for chronic shoulder subluxation and the 4th was Latarjet procedure for recurrent shoulder dislocation. All patients received paracetamol 1g at the end of the procedure and every 6 h postoperatively. No patient experienced pain during recovery and the analgesia lasted for a mean duration of 347.5 minutes. Tramadol was required for rescue analgesia in only one patient (Latarjet surgery). We found that SSAX block provided effective analgesia in all patients, but needs randomized controlled trials with larger sample size comparing with interscalene block.",

      "abstract": "The current opioid epidemic in the United States began 20 years ago and has become the leading cause of accidental deaths in the country. This crisis prompted us to explore trends in opioid abuse and dependence worldwide. We sought to identify other countries at high-risk of opioid use disorders, using the World Health Organization's (WHO) pharmacovigilance database. We performed a disproportionality analysis using VigiBase, the WHO Global Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) database. Five opioids used worldwide were included: oxycodone, fentanyl, morphine, tramadol, and codeine. We extracted all ICSRs associated with the drugs of interest, considered as suspect medication and recorded up until 5 June 2021, using the narrow Standardised MedDRA Query (SMQ) for drug abuse and dependence. Countries with at least one ICSR for each of the five opioids were retained. The relationship between the use of a drug (i.e. an opioid) and the occurrence of an adverse drug reaction (i.e. drug abuse and dependence) for each country was assessed by calculating the information component (IC) and its 99.9% CI [IC ; IC ], using a quasi-Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN). A hierarchical cluster analysis (Ward's method) of the IC value for each of the five opioids was performed to identify subgroups of countries with similar reported risks of opioid abuse and dependence. Among 21 countries, the optimal number of clusters was calculated to be four, each with a Jaccard index >0.5 (0.95, 0.78, 0.65 and 0.75, respectively). Six countries with the highest signals of drug abuse and dependence were identified in cluster 1, with significant CIs for the five opioids of interest (IC  > 0), ranging from 0.9 to 5.8 for the lower endpoint. There appear to be four distinct clusters of countries with similar opioid abuse and dependence profiles. The group with the highest reported risk for the opioids oxycodone, fentanyl, morphine, tramadol and codeine includes Australia, Canada, France, Germans, the United Kingdom and the United States.",

      "abstract": "This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine whether tramadol intake increases the risk of bleeding in patients receiving oral anticoagulants. This systematic review was registered on PROSPERO, CRD42022327230. We searched PubMed and Embase up to 14 April 2022, and references and citations of included studies were screened. Comparative and non-comparative studies exploring bleeding complications among adult patients on oral anticoagulants and tramadol were included. Risk of bias was assessed using an adaptation of the Drug Interaction Probability Scale for case reports and case series and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for comparative studies. A meta-analysis was performed for the risk of serious bleeding (leading to hospitalisation or death) associated with tramadol in patients on vitamin K antagonists. A total of 17 studies were included: 1 case series, 12 case reports, 2 case-control studies and 2 cohort studies. Most of the studies described tramadol-vitamin K antagonists' concomitant use; one case-control study also assessed dabigatran and rivaroxaban; one case report involved dabigatran. Among case reports/series, a total of 33 patients had a bleeding complication while using tramadol and an oral anticoagulant. The 4 comparative studies reported an increased bleeding risk during tramadol and vitamin K antagonist intake which was statistically significant in one study; the pooled risk ratio of serious bleeding was 2.68 [95% CI: 1.45 to 4.96; p < 0.001]. This systematic review confirms an association between tramadol use and risk of bleeding in patients on vitamin K antagonists. Evidence is too limited to assess whether this risk extends to patients on direct oral anticoagulants, and further studies are needed.",

      "abstract": "Motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) are one of the main causes of mortality in developing countries. Although the association between alcohol and the risk of MVA has been known for a long time, only a few studies have been conducted on driving following substance consumption in a short period of time. This is while narcotic and stimulant use seems to be a threat to traffic safety and a serious health concern for substance users. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of substance use (narcotics and stimulants) in drivers with traffic injuries admitted to the orthopedic ward of Imam Khomeini Hospital between October 2020 and June 2021. The current research is a cross-sectional, descriptive-analytical study. The statistical population consisted of 77 patients admitted to the orthopedic ward of a training hospital (Imam Khomeini) in Mazandaran Province, northern Iran. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine the quantitative variables. The sampling method is random and consecutive. The method of data collection was through questionnaire tools. The software used was SPSS 26 with an independent -test, Mann-Whitney  test, Chi-square or Fisher's exact test. In this study, the frequency of substance use was 18.18%. The prevalence of opioid usage was 35.7% and for stimulants it was 64.28%. There was no case of concomitant use of opioids and stimulants. In the opioid group, 60% of patients used opium, 20% methadone, and 20% tramadol. In the stimulant and alcohol groups, 12.12% utilized methamphetamine and 88.88% drank alcohol. The average age of consumers was 39 years, which was significantly higher in the opioid group (P = 0.040). The education level of substance users was remarkably lower (P < 0.05) and, occupationally, there was no statistically significant difference between groups of substance users (P = 0.290). Considerably, the unemployed population consumed more substances (P = 0.001). Multiple fractures (P < 0.05) and surgical treatment (P = 0.012) were more common in the user group. Users of stimulants and alcohol were younger than opioid users, according to our results. There is an association between drug use and the incidence of traffic accidents, as well as lower educational levels, masculinity, fracture type, and patient complication type.",

      "abstract": "To compare the postoperative analgesia efficacy of dexamethasone added to low-dose high-volume bupivacaine in ultrasound-guided supraclavicular brachial plexus block for adult patients who underwent upper limb orthopedic surgeries at Tibebe Ghion Specialized Hospital, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia. An observational prospective cohort study was conducted from 1 September 2021 to 30 January 2022. Using a systematic random sampling technique, 56 patients (equal groups of 28 patients) aged 18-60 years scheduled for elective upper limb orthopedic surgeries under supraclavicular block were recruited. According to the discretion of anesthetists' management plan of supraclavicular block, those patients who received 38 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine with 2 mL (8 mg) dexamethasone as the case group (DB) while those patients who received 40 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine alone as the cohort group (B). Time to first analgesic request, onset of sensory and motor, and motor block duration were analyzed with Student's -test whereas pain severity and analgesic consumption were assessed using the Mann-Whitney  test. Categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square test. -value less than 0.05 considered statistically significant. Postoperative analgesia had significantly prolonged in the dexamethasone bupivacaine group with a mean duration of 1098.00 ± 195.90 min compared to 464.29 ± 113.75 min in the bupivacaine alone group, -value < 0.001. Moreover, the dexamethasone bupivacaine group significantly consumed less total tramadol and diclofenac than bupivacaine alone, with a median dose of 0 (0-50) versus 50 (21.25-78.75) mg and 40 (0-50) versus 65 (47.50-77.50) mg, respectively. The median visual analogue scale scores were significantly reduced at 6th, 8th, 12th, and 24th hour in the dexamethasone bupivacaine group. Dexamethasone added to low-dose high-volume of bupivacaine in supraclavicular brachial plexus block significantly prolonged the duration of analgesia.",

      "abstract": "The interpretation of analytical results in forensic postmortem (PM) cases often poses a great challenge, in particular due to possible PM redistribution (PMR) phenomena. In terms of new synthetic opioids, such data are usually not available and if so, they are from case reports without the exact knowledge of dose, user habits, time of consumption or PM interval. Hence, a controlled toxicokinetic pig study was performed allowing the examination of PM tissue distribution and possible PMR of U-47700, tramadol and the main metabolites N-desmethyl-U-47700 and O-desmethyltramadol (ODT). For this purpose, twelve domestic pigs received an intravenous dose of 100 µg/kg body weight (BW) U-47700 or 1,000 µg/kg BW tramadol, respectively. The animals were put to death with T61 eight hours after administration and relevant organs, tissues and body fluids were sampled. Subsequently, the animals were stored at room temperature (RT) and samples were taken again after 24, 48, and 72 hours PM. Following homogenization and solid-phase extraction, quantification was performed applying a standard addition approach and liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Only low to moderate concentration changes of U-47700, tramadol and their main metabolites were found in the analyzed tissue specimens and body fluids during storage at RT depending on the chosen PM interval. On the contrary, a remarkable concentration increase of tramadol was observed in liver tissue. These findings indicate that both synthetic opioids as well as their main metabolites are only slightly prone to PMR and central blood might be the matrix of choice for quantification of these substances.",

In this case, a 77-year-old man developed distal penile pain, hours after undergoing PAE. Within days, he experienced tissue necrosis involving the glans penis. Treatment with tramadol, tadalafil, topical lidocaine, and hyperbaric oxygenation was initiated, and the necrosis resolved after fifteen days. There are no standard treatments for penile necrosis after PAE. Hyperbaric oxygenation may be effective in reducing ischemia-related tissue loss and may be considered as a treatment option for penile necrosis that occurs as a complication of PAE.",

      "abstract": "Tramadol, a weak opioid, inhibits the reuptake of serotonin, a key feature on vascular homeostasis. A suspected interaction exists between dabigatran and tramadol, which might trigger an excess on risk of bleeding however, there is a gap in knowledge on this topic. To estimate the effects of tramadol, dabigatran and concomitant use on the risk of hospitalized major bleeds (Gastrointestinal bleeding and intra-extracranial bleeds). Among a validated established cohort of new users of oral anticoagulants for non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) aged 18 years or older, we identified all hospitalized bleed episodes (GIB and extra/intracranial bleeds) within 2008-2015. A nested case-control analysis was conducted using conditional logistic regression. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for dabigatran, tramadol, and concomitant use. Several sensitivity analyses were carried out. aORs (95%CIs) for current use of only dabigatran, only tramadol and concomitant users were 1.73 (1.37-2.18) and 1.38 (1.13-1.67) and 2.04 (0.74-5.67) compared with non-users of both drugs (>365 days). aORs for current continuers and non-continuer users of dabigatran were 1.36 (1.00-1.86) and 2.19 (1.61-2.98), respectively. For the latter, non-continuer users with a short duration of dabigatran cumulated the highest risk (3.36 [1.88-5.99]). There also was an increased risk with concomitant use of tramadol and rivaroxaban (2.24 [1.19-4.21]), or antagonist of vitamin K (1.30 [1.00-1.69]). There was a trend towards and increased risk of excess bleeds when using concomitantly with dabigatran. The effect decreases with a narrower definition of current use.",

      "abstract": "Acute pancreatitis (AP) during pregnancy is a rare presentation with an estimated incidence of 1 case per 1000 to 10,000 pregnancies. Severe epigastric and abdominal pain is the earliest and the most common symptom of AP, and adequate pain relief is an integral part of patient management. The aim of our study was to investigate the different pain relief modalities that are used in pregnant women with AP and the efficacy of each method used, in terms of better pain relief and maternal-fetal outcomes. This was a retrospective observational study over a period of 6 years conducted at a tertiary care hospital. Pregnant women with clinical and biochemical diagnoses of acute pancreatitis were included in the study. Patient's history and clinical and biochemical data were collected from the medical records of the hospital. A total of 12 patients were included in the study, 5 out of 12 patients had gall stones associated with AP, 2 patients had hypertriglyceridemia, and 1 each had preeclampsia and eclampsia. Epidural analgesia at the level of L1-L2 spinal level showed a reduction of VAS scores from 8 or 9 to 1 or 2, indicating excellent pain as compared to  intravenous (i/v) infusion of fentanyl or i/v boluses of injection tramadol, in whom VAS was never reduced below 3. With satisfactory results, labour analgesia and anesthesia for caesarean section was provided via the same catheter in 2 and 3 patients, respectively. Maternal and fetal outcomes were comparable in all the patients. AP in pregnancy, when diagnosed early and managed accordingly, leads to better maternal and fetal outcomes. Epidural analgesia was better than intravenous analgesia in terms of pain management and better recovery of acute pancreatitis patients. In these patients, labour analgesia and anesthesia for caesarean section can be provided through the same catheter, making it a potential novel modality in the treatment of acute pancreatitis in pregnancy.",

      "abstract": "Abdominal wall blocks are frequently used due to the use of effective blocks, such as the transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block and the widespread use of ultrasound (US) imaging. A good knowledge of abdominal innervation is required for the use of abdominal wall blocks. We describe the extraordinary performance of external oblique intercostal (EOI) blocks in 3 different surgeries. Case 1: A man aged 30 to 35 was taken to the operating room for open liver surgery. After surgery, unilateral EOI block and bilateral TAP block were performed with the patient in the supine position, and a catheter was placed under the external oblique muscle. Postoperative analgesia was followed by patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) through the catheter. Case 2: A male patient aged 35 to 40 was taken to the operating room for laparoscopic liver surgery. After surgery, unilateral (EOI) block and bilateral TAP block were performed with the patient in the supine position. The patient received iv tramadol PCA (bolus dose 10 mg only, lockout 20 minutes). Case 3: A man aged 25 to 30 was taken to the operating room for laparoscopic bariatric surgery. After the surgery, bilateral EOI and bilateral rectal sheath blocks were performed with the patient in the supine position. The patient received iv tramadol PCA (bolus dose 10 mg only, lockout 20 minutes). All patients had low NRS scores in the recovery unit and very low opioid consumption in the first 72 hours postoperatively. All were satisfied with the quality of analgesia. We think that EOI block will come to occupy a significant place in upper abdominal analgesia, especially in obese patients, due to its wide innervation area and ease of application.",

      "abstract": "An approximately 12-year-old, 31 kg, male neutered Labrador Retriever was presented to the referring hospital with an acute onset (less than 1 day) of hematemesis and melena. The dog was treated supportively for a presumptive gastric ulcer for 4 days with intravenous fluids, gastro protectants, such as pantoprazole, misoprostol, sucralfate, and barium, as well as an anti-emetic (maropitant) and analgesics (fentanyl, gabapentin, and tramadol). Throughout medical management, the dog continued to require blood transfusions approximately every 24 h. Given the poor medical response, the patient was subjected to an exploratory laparotomy. During surgery, a grossly raised, blister-like lesion on the mucosal surface of the stomach was appreciated on the lesser curvature of the stomach. A partial gastrectomy was performed, and the segment was submitted for histological evaluation. Histologically, there were multiple, tortuous, medium-caliber muscular arteries (>1.0 mm in diameter) in the submucosa. A single large-caliber artery (>0.75 mm in diameter) containing a partially occlusive thrombus extruded through the mucosa and projected on the ulcerated surface. The patient's signs were similar clinically and histopathologically to Dieulafoy's lesion in people. A Dieulafoy's lesion is a potentially life-threatening disorder that causes gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage. This lesion is characterized by a dilated, large-caliber, aberrant submucosal artery that erodes through the epithelium and ruptures, resulting in massive and potentially fatal hemorrhage. This lesion has never been documented previously in a dog.",

The rarity of these conditions has limited their research as well as the ability to recognise and treat them effectively. We present the case of a 61-year-old male who developed altered mental status, respiratory distress, fever, and haemodynamic instability following post-operative administration of tramadol and meperidine. The differential diagnosis process and process of elimination were used to diagnose this patient with serotonin syndrome. Chart review was used to review the details of the case to write this report. Serotonin syndrome was eventually diagnosed in the context of the symptoms following the administration of 2 serotonergic agents. The patient's symptoms improved with supportive care and did not recur. This case is one of the first published reports of serotonin syndrome resulting from an interaction between tramadol and meperidine, highlighting the importance of constant vigilance in the perioperative period when serotonergic agents are involved. The increased usage of serotonergic antidepressants and Enhanced Recovery After Surgery protocols calling for serotonergic analgesics represent a significant and underrecognised potential for serotonergic multidrug interactions to occur.",

      "abstract": "Ineffective pain control is the most commonly cited reason for misuse of prescription opioids and is influenced by genetics. In particular, the gene encoding the CYP2D6 enzyme, which metabolizes some of the most commonly prescribed opioids (e.g., tramadol, hydrocodone) to their more potent forms, is highly polymorphic and can lead to reduced concentrations of the active metabolites and decreased opioid effectiveness. Consideration of the  genotype may allow for predicting opioid response and identifying patients who are likely to respond well to lower potency opioids as well as those who may derive greater pain relief from non-opioid analgesics versus certain opioids. There is emerging evidence that a -guided approach to pain management improves pain control and reduces opioid consumption and thus may be a promising means for combating opioid misuse. Clinical practice guidelines are available for select opioids and other analgesics to support medication and dose selection based on pharmacogenetic data. This article describes the evidence supporting genotype-guided pain management as a means of improving pain control and reducing opioid misuse and clinical recommendations for genotype-guided analgesic prescribing. In addition, a \"how to\" guide using patient case examples is provided to demystify the process for implementing pharmacogenetics-guided pain management in order to optimize analgesia and minimize adverse effects. Optimizing pain management through genotype-guided approaches may ultimately provide safer and more effective therapy for pain control while decreasing the risk for opioid misuse.",

However, growing evidence suggests a link between opioid system dysfunction and suicidal behaviors, raising the question of tramadol use in view of the high addictive and suicidal risk. Here, we present the case of a young adult woman with multiple suicide attempts related to tramadol addiction. A 25-year-old woman was admitted for suicide attempt by phlebotomy in the Department of Psychiatric Emergency and Acute Care, Montpellier (France), in March 2020. The suicide attempt occurred 3 days after an abrupt tramadol withdrawal. In 2018, due to spinal disc herniation, she had a first prescription of tramadol to which she became addicted. The patient described an effect on psychological pain and suicidal ideation. However, she had to increase tramadol dose to obtain the desired effects, and for several months her intake was 2 000 mg per day. When she could not obtain tramadol any longer, suicidal ideation and psychological pain increased, leading to the suicide attempt. At the time of a worldwide opioid crisis that contributes to increasing suicidal behaviors, this case raises questions about tramadol prescription (often considered to be less addictive and with lower abuse potential) to individuals at risk of suicide.",

      "abstract": "Utilizing pharmacogenomics (PGx) and integrating drug-induced phenoconversion to guide opioid therapies could improve the treatment response and decrease the occurrence of adverse drug events. Genetics contribute to the interindividual differences in opioid response. The purpose of this case report highlights the impact of a PGx-informed medication safety review, assisted by a clinical decision support system, in mitigating the drug-gene and drug-drug-gene interactions (DGI and DDGI, respectively) that increase the risk of an inadequate drug response and adverse drug events (ADEs). This case describes a 69-year-old female who was referred for PGx testing for uncontrolled chronic pain caused by osteoarthritis and neuropathy. The clinical pharmacist reviewed the PGx test results and medication regimen and identified several (DGIs and DDGIs, respectively) at Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 and CYP2D6. The recommendations were to: (1) switch tramadol to buprenorphine transdermal patch, an opioid with lower potential for ADEs, to mitigate a CYP2D6 DDGI; (2) gradually discontinue amitriptyline to alleviate the risk of anticholinergic side effects, ADEs, and multiple DDGIs; and (3) optimize the pregabalin. The provider and the patient agreed to implement these recommendations. Upon follow-up one month later, the patient reported an improved quality of life and pain control. Following the amitriptyline taper, the patient experienced tremors in the upper and lower extremities. When the perpetrator drug, omeprazole, was stopped, the metabolic capacity was no longer impeded; the patient experienced possible amitriptyline withdrawal symptoms due to the rapid withdrawal of amitriptyline, which was reinitiated and tapered off more slowly. This case report demonstrates a successful PGx-informed medication safety review that considered drug-induced phenoconversion and mitigated the risks of pharmacotherapy failure, ADEs, and opioid misuse.",

      "abstract": "Novel opioids in the illicit drug supply, such as the \"nitazene\" group of synthetic opioids, present an ongoing public health problem due to high potency and respiratory depressant effects. We describe three patients in whom -piperidinyl etonitazene, a compound not previously reported in human exposure, was detected after suspected opioid overdose. Other substances that these patients tested for included fentanyl, cocaine, levamisole, phenacetin, benzoylecgonine, -fluorofentanyl, presumptive heroin (tested as 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM), morphine, and codeine), and tramadol. This is a case series of patients with acute opioid overdose enrolled in an ongoing multicenter prospective cohort study. Data collected included reported substance use, clinical course, naloxone dose and response, outcome, and analytes detected in biological samples. Between October 6, 2020 and October 31, 2021, 1006 patients were screened and 412 met inclusion criteria. Of these, three patients (age 33-55) tested positive for -piperidinyl etonitazene at one site in New Jersey over a period of three days in July 2021. Two patients reported the use of cocaine; one reported the use of heroin and alprazolam. All three patients received naloxone with improvement in their mental status (2 milligrams (mg) intranasally (IN); 8 mg IN; 0.08 mg intravenous (IV)). Two of three received subsequent doses for recurrence of opioid toxicity (0.4-0.6 mg IV). One patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and admitted to the intensive care unit, one was discharged from the Emergency Department (ED), and one used additional drug while in the ED and required admission for a naloxone infusion. None developed organ damage or sequelae. These cases represent a local outbreak of a novel \"nitazene\" opioid. Public health toxicosurveillance should incorporate routine testing of this emerging class of synthetic compounds in the illicit drug supply.",

      "abstract": "Tramadol is an opioid pain medication used to treat moderate to severe pain. Tramadol consumers tend to co-abuse some other substances such as opium, cigarettes, alcohol, and cannabis and each of these substances may impair trace elements homeostasis in the body. Therefore, this case-control study aimed to compare the urinary concentration of some essential and toxic elements in tramadol addiction alone and its co-abuse with cigarette and opium in Western Iran. For this purpose, urine samples were collected in two groups of tramadol (n = 72) and control subjects (n = 62) from March to November 2020. The case group was divided into three groups: tramadol alone, tramadol + opium, and tramadol + cigarettes. Moreover, ICP-MS (Agilent 7900) was used to measure trace element concentrations in the urine samples. Based on our results, Fe was the only element markedly higher among controls as compared to tramadol users (p < 0.001). Moreover, the concentration levels of As appeared to be the same among both groups, but the levels of other elements including Ca, Cd, Cr, Mn, Cu, Zn, Co, Ni, Se, and Pb were all significantly higher among tramadol users as compared to control group. The rank-based regression analysis illustrated that no contribution of sex and age effect was found by the regression model on the levels of all 12 studied elements. While, smoking was found to affect the levels of Fe (β = 0.163, P = 0.025) and Co (β = 0.411, p < 0.001) so that smoking reduced Fe levels but elevated Co concentration levels. Abuse of tramadol along with cigarettes and opium increased the concentration of some heavy metals in urine samples compared to the control group. However, these results showed no significant effect of age, sex, smoking habit, and amount of tramadol usage on the levels of trace elements.",

      "abstract": "The presence of emerging contaminants in water and wastewater resources is of ongoing concern for public health and safety. Pharmaceutical compounds are designed to be biologically active and therefore may have effects on nontarget organisms in terrestrial and aquatic environments, even at trace concentrations. The presence of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in wastewater treatment plants is reported in various countries worldwide, mostly in the levels of nanograms to micrograms per litre. The present study investigates the thermal degradation of municipal sewage sludge containing PPCPs at various heating rates. The examined characteristics of the samples include thermal decomposition behavior, volatile release characteristics, and pyrolytic product composition. Thermal characterization of the PPCPs was conducted using differential scanning calorimetry. The gaseous products and typical functional groups of the released volatiles detected by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy mainly contained CO, CO, small-chain hydrocarbons, and oxygen- and nitrogen-containing functional groups together with other species. In addition, the potential of bioenergy production was investigated as a spin-off opportunity during thermal degradation of biosolids. Study results showed that PPCP concentrations can be lowered significantly by thermal treatment of municipal biosolids. Antifungal/antibacterial agents together with opioids, in particular triclosan and tramadol, showed less resistance to thermal degradation while antibiotics could be more recalcitrant to heat treatment. The thermodynamic results provide an important reference for future reactor design and the thermochemical treatment of biosolids as well as their conversion to value-added products.",
